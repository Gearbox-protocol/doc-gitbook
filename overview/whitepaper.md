# Tech Paper

{% hint style="info" %}
This paper was written in summer 2021. However, the protocol has undergone quite a few changes after the initial version. Those changes are not reflected in the paper below. Why? Because there are user docs, there are [medium articles](https://medium.com/gearbox-protocol/product-evolution-v2-gearbox-protocol-from-1-to-2-going-further-dcedf3b5d959), there is open-source code, there is dev documentation... As such, it makes no sense to waste time on improving a "paper". Those are mostly used for initial pre-launch stages. However, in case you really want to see a _whitepaper_, this one is OK. Ask more in [Discord](https://discord.gg/JssNVvxscK)!
