# Tech Paper

{% hint style="success" %}
The protocol has undergone quite a few changes after its initial version designed in 2021, which are not reflected in the paper below. Why? Because there are user docs, there are medium articles, there is open-source code.... As such, it makes no sense to waste time on improving a "paper" that is usually only used for initial lunch stages. However, in case you really want to see a "whitepaper", the one below is OK to read. Ask more in [Discord](https://discord.gg/JssNVvxscK)!
