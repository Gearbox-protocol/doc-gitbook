# Tech Paper

{% hint style="success" %}
This paper was written in summer 2021. However, the protocol has undergone quite a few changes after the initial version. Those changes are not reflected in the paper below. Why? Because there are user docs, there are medium articles, there is open-source code, there is dev documentation... As such, it makes no sense to waste time on improving a "paper" that is usually only used for initial lunch stages. However, in case you really want to see a _whitepaper_, the one below is OK.
