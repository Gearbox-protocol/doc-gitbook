# Community Delegates

{% hint style="info" %}
**Where is the DAO, how can I contribute?**

You can be in a DAO but not be 24/7 active, which is totally okay. There are different ways to get involved and get rewarded for your time and skills.&#x20;

* **Core contributors**: work on different tasks as core contributors, ranging from marketing to coding. DAO contributors are split among different sub-projects and can decide to work on something specific, or a few tasks at a time. [See Notion](https://gearboxprotocol.notion.site/Gearbox-DAO-23966f122ae4421492819242b30a0e7a).&#x20;
* **Delegates**: members who stay on top of protocol strategic ideas and plans, but don’t have the 24/7 to really get hands-on operational tasks. They can become delegates and lead how [governance](./) decides on protocol vital things.&#x20;
* **Shitposters**: you can meme, learn, and discuss DeFi in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gearbox).

Delegates have been an important governance component since even before the MakerDAO times!

## How to delegate your GEAR

It takes literally 1 minute!

1. Choose [a delegate you like from the list below](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p7Ff6UdyBEo3086rc3EqftnSVxGw2-8q1qJFQDcKqxU/edit?usp=sharing). Before delegating, feel free to ask questions in Discord by tagging that delegate, and DYOR on why you have chosen that candidate. Check their forum history, see for what they stand for in terms of strategy ideas.
2. 2\. Go to [https://snapshot.org/#/delegate/gearbox.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate/gearbox.eth) and connect the wallet where you have your [GEAR](broken-reference). Or if you have Curve LP GEAR-ETH or other strategy that snapshot governance currently supports based on the latest votes. And don’t worry, just connecting is safe.
3. Insert a delegate's address or ENS and click **confirm**. This will cost a little bit of gas. This is just a delegate function, you are not giving any approvals or other scary things. Besides, your GEAR is not locked. You can undelegate or move them freely. But if you do either one of these things, your delegate will lose the corresponding number of votes, of course.

Overall, the list is just to help you check who is an active Delegate responsible for keeping Gearbox DAO and protocol secure and vibrant. You can ask questions before delegating to any one candidate in Discord, and check their previous history. For example, [this Messari board](https://messari.io/asset/gearbox) can help you see what and how delegates voted.

### How to be a Delegate

* Have an active discord profile, and optionally - twitter. Spread the word!&#x20;
* Be on as many contributor calls as possible. After all, they are monthly at most, so they shouldn’t take too much of your time. You need to be on top of the discussions.
* Try to be reachable from time to time so that those who delegated to you can ask questions and see what your viewpoint is on certain topics. Participate in forum and discord discussions where you think it is necessary. You are a governance member, so - govern!

Join [Discord and ask any questions](https://discord.com/invite/gearbox)!
