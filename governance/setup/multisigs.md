# Multisigs

Multisig roles were split into a financial-treasury and technical. Both multisigs were created prior to the deployment ceremony by previous initial core members, as contracts needed to know the wallet addresses. Then, multisig members and a signer count requirement were added after **DAO voting procedures**. All this can be verified on-chain and Etherscan in logs of respective contracts.

Multisig must execute whatever proposal reaches winning quorum. Given that multisig are members previously enacted by token holders, meaning the DAO, and are semi-public people with big reputation - in _extreme_ cases they could voice against implementing some proposal. However, that could breach _trust_ in the governance model and require immediate action and restructuring. This must be exercised carefully.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Technical Multisig will not have a timelock function just yet, for security purposes. The pause function was awarded to [2 analytical addresses](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-17-multisig-reshuffle-pausable-admin/1447), while the unpause function is in the hands of the same technical multisig, but a 3/10 for better response time. That is [0xbb803559b4d58b75e12dd74641ab955e8b0df40e](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xbb803559B4D58b75E12dd74641AB955e8B0Df40E).
