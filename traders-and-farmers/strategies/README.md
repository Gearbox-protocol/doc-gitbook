# Strategies

Gearbox Protocol allows for multiple collateral types and interactions within a Credit Account. While a developer can run all of the complex interactions on-chain, interface helps non-technical users to ape into strategies with one click thanks to multicall. What it does is:

* Open a Credit Account based on your collateral, leverage, etc. selected;
* Swap some assets if needed to the ones needed for a specific farm you chose;
* LP, stake, etc. to end up in that destination as you have chosen.
