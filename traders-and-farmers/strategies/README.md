# Strategies

Gearbox Protocol allows for multiple collateral types and interactions within a Credit Account. As such, even though the protocol starts with simple buy-sell at first - the governance process could vote in new protocols, assets, and parameters if the protocol ends up to be interesting to the community. This would make it possible to run complex hedge fund strategies with leverage.
