# Leverage Farming

{% hint style="success" %}
Before you go any further, just know that [https://app.gearbox.fi/accounts/strategies/list](https://app.gearbox.fi/accounts/strategies/list) has the list of strategies that ape for you in one click! That's right: you configure your collateral asset(s), debt asset, leverage factor... and it does all of it for you in one click. So if you just wanna do some vanilla farming - this could be the recipe for you. But keep reading to learn about other hot stuff possible with composable leverage.
{% endhint %}

While a developer can run all of the complex interactions onchain, executing these by going protocol to protocol is a tough task. Gearbox devs have worked this out, to have the dApp help non-technical users **ape into strategies with one click thanks to "One-Click Strategies"**.&#x20;

What it enables in 1 go, is:

* Open a Credit Account based on your preferred collateral, leverage, etc.;
* Swap assets if needed to the ones needed for a specific farm you chose;
* LP, stake, etc. to end up in that destination as you have chosen.

Done! From assets X Y Z -> to taking leverage with Gearbox -> to swapping those into other assets -> to depositing and then staking in the protocols you chose. **All in one click!**
