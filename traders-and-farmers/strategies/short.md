# \[Farming] Short

If you want to go short ETH to USD, you need to open a Credit Account denominated in ETH.&#x20;

Then you can sell all the ETH within your Credit Account to USDC. You can use those USDC to leverage farm or do something else then. The same strategy goes for going short WBTC against ETH or some other asset available. [Open Credit Account and try it](https://app.gearbox.fi/).

#### Farming Short

After that, you can put the USDC into Yearn or whatever other farming protocol is available. depending on interest rates in Gearbox Protocol and interest rates in Yearn or another farming protocol, you can actually get a _self-repaying short or even a net-paying short_.

![You basically get a short which then makes you money yield farming, and the yield farming LP tokens you can potentially utilize for something else. The lego building blocks can all happen within Credit Accounts!](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-19 at 00.41.47.png>)

It doesn't matter which third-party protocol - Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc. - you choose. You decide where you want the trade to be executed. After a transaction is confirmed, your short is in effect.
