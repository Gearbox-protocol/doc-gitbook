# Leveraged Liquid Staking

With the Gearbox integration, you’ll be able to lever up staking as per your risk and debt \[borrowed] asset preference to get access to true leveraged staking… But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. **Beyond the leveraged ETH, it’s the stETH you receive that enables composability across multiple more DeFi protocols**. And each protocol enables you to earn even more APY. Here are the possible strategies, **all available through One Click.**

#### 1. Pure leveraged staking yields in stETH <a href="#a600" id="a600"></a>

The stETH is what you receive when you stake ETH, with the ability to deploy directly on the [LIDO protocol](https://stake.lido.fi/). At the moment, there’s about 5.9B$ of ETH staked on LIDO with stETH trading at 0.995ETH. stETH ideally is supposed to maintain a _peg_ against ETH but market conditions can make it lose peg which can lead to your health factor dropping, this has previously happened and you should manage your risk accordingly.

#### 2. Convex stETHCrv <a href="#82c4" id="82c4"></a>

Convex Finance allows users to stake steCRV LP tokens into their vault, to farm LDO, CVX, trading fees, as well as boosted CRV rewards — without the need for users to lock-up CRV themselves. This is on top of the staking APY of stETH (the portion that remains as stETH inside the Curve Finance pool). At the moment the APY on the same is 5.59% which enables a healthy source of yield on your directional trades.

#### 3. Yearn stETHCrv <a href="#cc9e" id="cc9e"></a>

The Curve stETH yVault is one of the highest TVL yearn vaults (\~$115m), and for good reason — the APY currently stands at 6.58%, which is pretty good for an ETH farming strategy. In comparison, the vanilla WETH yVault is currently yielding 0.47%. Yearn has very similar sources of yield to Convex but unlike convex it sells off the rewards earned to then redeposit ETH/stETH into the vault.

#### 4. Curve stETH <a href="#471f" id="471f"></a>

The [Curve stETH](https://curve.fi/steth) is one of the highest TVL vaults (\~1.6B$) in DeFi, and for good reason — the APY currently stands at 3.36%, which is pretty good for an ETH farming strategy. The Curve stETH Pool takes Lido stETH (liquid staked ETH), puts it in a curve pool with vanilla ETH.

So these are pretty neat strategies that you have ready to deploy anytime you want to. You can read the exact details for LIDO below or continue onto our next set of strategies.
