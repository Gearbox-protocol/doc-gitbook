One-click strategies do what the name suggests: open leveraged positions in your preferred pool/protocol in just one transaction. Multicall feature of Gearbox essentially bundles all the complex \[swap->LP->deposit] operations into just 1 transaction, also saving you a bunch of gas.

But not just that, One Click Strategies let you **go from having no Credit Account -> to having a Credit Account open and already aping into a strategy you choose**. You choose the leverage, the debt asset, the riskâ€¦ And you can always ape out as easily!

1. Choose your debt \[borrow] asset
2. Choose your collateral(s) which can be multiple
3. Choose your leverage factor x
4. Choose where you want to ape in

Single click strategies use a **Smart Router** \[our pathfinder] to find the most efficient manner to get the assets for a strategy while **Multicall** ensures that efficiency turns into execution in one click. It saves you the time & gas from doing all of the steps by yourself.

**See for yourself and ape in:**
