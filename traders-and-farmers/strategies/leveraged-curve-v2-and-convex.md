### **1. Tricrypto2 Curve Pool**

The [tricrypto2](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/tricrypto2/deposit) pool comprises of USDT, WBTC and ETH. It’s often used as a sort of index for the two crypto majors when depositing USDT. With Gearbox, you can lever up ETH and deposit into the pool to access leverage.&#x20;

The max leverage available for the pool will be _**8.33X.**_ Basis historical APYs, this makes earning low double digit APYs possible.

You can then put those Curve LP tokens in Convex. This will give you some \[boosted] CRV rewards as well as CVX rewards, next to trading fees of the pool.

**2-3. CVX/ETH and LDO/ETH Curve Pools**

CVX/ETH and LDO/ETH are factory pools with just 2 assets each. Since you lever up ETH and then deposit into the pools, you are effectively gaining leveraged exposure to CVX/LDO itself.&#x20;

For both, the [LDO/ETH pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crypto-204/deposit) and the [CVX/ETH pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/cvxeth/deposit), the max leverage available will be _**5.55X.**_ Based upon historic APYs, this makes earning significant double digit APYs possible.

Since CVX and LDO are more volatile assets, it’ll be important to exercise better risk management while farming than other non-volatile pools. The features that’ll help you manage this is a CA are detailed in our docs, [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/traders-and-farmers/credit-account-dashboard-overview/kak-ne-byt-rekt).
