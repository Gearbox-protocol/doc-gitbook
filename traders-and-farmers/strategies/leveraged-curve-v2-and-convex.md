### **Tricrypto2 Curve Pool**

The [tricrypto2](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/tricrypto2/deposit) pool comprises of USDT, WBTC and ETH. Itâ€™s often used as a sort of index for the two crypto majors when depositing USDT. With Gearbox, you can lever up ETH and deposit into the pool to access leverage. The max leverage available for the pool will be _**8.33X.**_ Basis historical APYs, this makes earning low double digit APYs possible.

You can then put those Curve LP tokens in Convex. This will give you some \[boosted] CRV rewards as well as CVX rewards, next to trading fees of the pool.
