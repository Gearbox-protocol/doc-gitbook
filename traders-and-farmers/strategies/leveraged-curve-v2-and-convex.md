# Leveraged Curve V2 and Convex

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Curve UI pools.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### **1. Tricrypto2 Curve Pool**

The [tricrypto2](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/tricrypto2/deposit) pool comprises of USDT, WBTC and ETH. It’s often used as a sort of index for the two crypto majors when depositing USDT. With Gearbox, you can lever up ETH and deposit into the pool to access leverage.&#x20;

The max leverage available for the pool will be _**8.33X.**_ The pool as of Aug'23 yields 5.13% organically at a TVL of $72M. With leverage, the max APY possible on the pool will be closer to **17.8% APY** depending on the ETH borrow rate.&#x20;

You can then put those Curve LP tokens in Convex. This will give you some \[boosted] CRV rewards as well as CVX rewards, next to trading fees of the pool.
{% endhint %}

**2-3. CVX/ETH and LDO/ETH Curve Pools**

CVX/ETH and LDO/ETH are factory pools with just 2 assets each. Since you lever up ETH and then deposit into the pools, you are effectively gaining leveraged exposure to CVX/LDO itself.&#x20;

For the [CVX/ETH pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/cvxeth/deposit), the max leverage available will be _**5.55X.**_ The pool as of Aug'23 yields 8.3% APY at a $16M TVL but with leverage the **max APY rises to 30.9%.**

For the [LDO/ETH pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crypto-204/deposit), the max leverage available will be _**5.55X.**_ The pool as of Aug'23 yields 19.7% APY at a $6.4M TVL but with leverage the **max APY rises to 95.2%.**

Since CVX and LDO are more volatile assets, it’ll be important to exercise better risk management while farming than other non-volatile pools. The features that’ll help you manage this is a CA are detailed in our docs, [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/traders-and-farmers/credit-account-dashboard-overview/kak-ne-byt-rekt).

**4. OHM-FraxBP pool**

The pool is made of Olympus DAO’s token, $OHM and FRAXBP. [FBP or Frax Base Pool](https://gov.curve.fi/t/deploy-a-fraxbp-pool-whitelist-frax-for-vecrv-staking/3958) is comporised of Frax and USDC. At launch, it’s max leverage will be _**8.33X.**_ As of Aug'23, the pool yields 5.14% organically. With leverage, users will be able to earn as much as 29.8% APY.

Just like CVX and LDO pools, exercise correct risk management when operating an OHM pool.
