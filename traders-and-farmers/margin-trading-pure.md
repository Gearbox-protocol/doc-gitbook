# Margin Trading - PURE

{% hint style="info" %}
Underneath, the protocol logic and contracts are the same! Different dApps simply help different user bases get to their desired positions quicker.
{% endhint %}

The PURE margin trading interface helps you enter leverage positions quickly!

1. You can either select how much of an asset quantity you want to long - and then change your initial capital amount / leverage factor. Or choose how much initial capital you want to go into a position with - and then chance your leverage. The interface responds to either case.
2. Check your liquidation price, leverage factor, borrow rate, slippage, and so on. You can later on fix these parameters as well, after the position is open. It's all customizable. The only thing that is staying in tact is your debt asset. That oen stays the same until you close the position.



## Why is it PURE?

The name PURE is not an abbreviation. It literally means _pure_ leverage. The reason why it's pure is because Gearbox leverage isn't about perpetuals or isolated liquidity. With Gearbox:

* you trade with real spot assets, no perps or synthetics;
* you trade with global DEX liquidity of Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, and other DEXes;
* you have no funding rates, only borrow rates which are often cheaper.&#x20;
* you can utulize your leverage positions in farming and constructing interesting strategies if you want to do so, for example, you can read more about that on the [Leverage 2.0 page](../what-can-you-do-with-leverage-2.0.md).

{% hint style="success" %}
If you would want to get more out of margin trading, you can later click on "Extended dApp" in the interface and configure your position further. For example, make your short or long - farm at the same time. Many of these [leverage 2.0 actions](../what-can-you-do-with-leverage-2.0.md) are possible, just dive in!
