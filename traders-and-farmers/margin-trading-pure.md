# Margin Trading: PURE

{% hint style="info" %}


Underneath, the protocol logic and contracts are the same! Different dApps simply help different user bases get to their desired positions quicker.
{% endhint %}

The PURE margin trading interface helps you enter leverage positions quickly!

1. **Flexible Leverage:** You can either select how much of an asset you want to long - and then change your initial capital amount OR leverage factor. Or choose how much initial capital you want to go into a position with - and then chance your leverage factor. The interface responds to either case.
2. **Position Monitoring and Management:** Check your liquidation price, leverage factor, borrow rate, slippage, and so on. You can also change these parameters later, after the position is open. It's all customizable. The only thing that is staying in tact is your debt asset. That stays the same until you close the position.
3. **Visualised Charts:** The chart will draw a line for you to show you the liquidation price. Once you adjust your collateral (add more or increase your debt instead) then the line will move accordingly to help you.

## Why is it PURE?

The name PURE is not an abbreviation. It literally means _pure_ leverage. The reason why it's pure is because Gearbox leverage isn't about perpetuals or isolated liquidity. With Gearbox:

* **Real Positions:** you trade with real spot assets, no perps or synthetics;
* **Deepest Liquidity:** you trade with global DEX liquidity of Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, and other DEXes;
* **Cheaper Rates:** you have no funding rates, only borrow rates which are often cheaper;
* **No Scam Wicks:** you have no price wicks like on BitMex, because oracles are not inwards-looking;
* **Farm with your leveraged position:** you can utilise your leverage positions in farming and constructing interesting strategies if you want to do so, for example, you can read more about that on the [Leverage 2.0 page](../what-can-you-do-with-leverage-2.0.md).

## What type of trading strategies can be implemented on PURE?

In terms of what you can do with margin trading, the following strategies are possible:&#x20;

* **Long Margin Trading:** Traders borrow funds to buy an asset with the expectation that its price will rise . The aim is to sell the asset at a higher price to repay the borrowed funds and keep the profit.&#x20;
* **Short Margin Trading:** Borrowing an asset to sell it with the expectation that its price will fall. Traders aim to buy back the asset at a lower price, repay the borrowed funds, and keep the profit. Since shorting depends on the assets you borrow, you can only short BTC, ETH and stables currently. Ability to short more assets will increase as their Lending pools are created.
* **Pairs Trading:** Simultaneously entering both long and short positions in two correlated assets. Traders aim to profit from the relative performance of the two assets. An example of this would be instantaneous leverage on the BTC/ETH pair, just borrow ETH on leverage and swap it to BTC. Same can be done to create other BTC and ETH relative pairs. More [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pairstrade.asp).
* **Basis trading:** Exploiting borrow rate differences of the same asset on different markets or exchanges while remaining delta neutral is a common strategy. You can long an asset on Gearbox for a borrow fee thatâ€™s lower than most funding fee and short the same asset elsewhere to earn funding fee. This enables you to stay delta neutral and still earn through the rate arbitrage
* **Boosted Longs/Shorts:** Gearbox is composable, you can go ahead and deploy your leveraged position on other protocols. This enables users to earn APYs on their leveraged positions by directly leverage trading assets like sDAI, yWETH, yDAI and yUSDC

If you would want to get more out of margin trading, you can later click on "Extended dApp" in the interface and configure your position further. For example, make your short or long - farm at the same time. Many of these [leverage 2.0 actions](../what-can-you-do-with-leverage-2.0.md) are possible, just dive in!
