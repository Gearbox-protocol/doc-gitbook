# Leverage Restaking & Points

There's not much that you need to say beyond "Earn 10 times more EIGEN and LRT points" to sell this concept. However, understanding why restaking changes the fabric of society and where the yields come from - will help users learn and make better informed decisions.

### Differences of leverage points and restaking vs vanilla farming

Leverage borrowers are prepared to pay high rates today - to get higher rates “tomorrow” thanks to the airdrops earned due to the points accrued. Quite a gamble, but so is any open market.

In that sense, **a leverage borrower is still technically leverage farming**… but **negative yields.** _Wait what?!_ - Yes, the organic rates for staking they get today are not large. What **these users want is the distribution of tokens due to the points they earn: EigenLayer, Renzo, EtherFi**, and others stacking up on top of each other. That’s where leverage users today see the \$$.
