# How to open a Credit Account

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn what a [Credit Account](../overview/credit-account/) is and how it works.
{% endhint %}

**Step 1.** Go to [Credit Accounts](https://app.beta.gearbox.fi/accounts/) page. Click on the asset you want to provide as collateral. The underlying asset is the asset you trade against, meaning all your positions are denominated in it.

**Note 1.** Once selected, the underlying asset in that particular account can't be changed. But you can open a new Credit Account with a different collateral asset. More details on how to select an underlying asset you can find in the [Strategies ](strategies/)section.

You can change the account name and select a skin for your Credit Account.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Step 2.** Specify the amount you want to put as collateral. This will be the notional amount from which the leverage X will be calculated. As such, 5 ETH "you pay" notional can be x5 more leverage, so 30 ETH position total.

**Step 3.** Select the leverage you want to get and click "Open position" button.
