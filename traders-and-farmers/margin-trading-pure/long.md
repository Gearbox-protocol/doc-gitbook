### Boosted Long: Free Leverage / Hedge

If you want to go long ETH to USDC, you need to open a Credit Account denominated in a stable coin.

* Go to the PURE margin trading: [https://pure.gearbox.fi/](https://pure.gearbox.fi/);
* Select ETH long and configure all the parameters;
* Click on the Boosted Trade box to turn your long into a farming long;
* You now have an ETH long that is paying you rewards rate (possibly) in higher numbers than the borrow rate on that USDC that you have to pay. It's a boosted leveraged trade!

{% hint style="success" %}
Depending on the interest rates in Gearbox Protocol and interest rates in Yearn or another protocol, you can actually get a _self-repaying long or even a net-paying long_.
