# How to borrow more

If you traded well and increased your position or you took too little leverage at the beginning - you will be able to borrow more. This reduces your health factor but gives you a bigger position.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to keep your health factor high enough, or you could be liquidated right after borrowing to the _MAX_ possible_._ Pay attention to not get liquidated, which incurs a fee.
