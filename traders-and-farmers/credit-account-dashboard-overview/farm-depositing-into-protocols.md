# Farm: depositing into protocols

This tab is a selection of farms (protocols where you can deposit capital). Since LP tokens of protocols usually do not have secondary market liquidity, depositing-withdrawing actions are better for a user to avoid slippage. That is why these actions are not on the [trade-swapping-assets.md](trade-swapping-assets.md "mention") tab.&#x20;

Once you deposit in a farm, you can top up or partly / fully exit.

{% hint style="success" %}
From A to Yearn deposit \[swap->deposit->deposit LP tokens] in one click!
{% endhint %}

* You can ape into farm with any asset you have. Smart Router will choose the best trade-swap-deposit route for you, so you don't have to think twice before going in.
* Once you get some rewards like CVX, LDO, CRV, or other emissions which require a claim action - the button will appear at the top of the Farm tab. You can claim whenever.
* You can choose to exit into an absolutely different asset too, thanks to Smart Router!
