# Trade- Swapping assets

The trade tab lets you convert your leveraged base asset to the asset of your choice as long as it is a part of the allowedlist&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../../overview/credit-account/allowedlist-policy.md" %}
[allowedlist-policy.md](../../overview/credit-account/allowedlist-policy.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Swapping your asset to another can have a direct impact to your health factor, please do keep a check on it in order to make sure you don't run a risk of liquidation.

Feel there's an asset that should available on trade? You can raise it to the community for it to be added to the Allowedlist.

You can use these swapped assets just for leveraging them or on our Adapter integrations through the connect page to earn yields as you want.
