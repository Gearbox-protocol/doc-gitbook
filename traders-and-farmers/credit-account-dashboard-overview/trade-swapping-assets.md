# Trade: swapping assets

The trade tab lets you trade (swap) any asset from one to another, as long as it is on the [allowedlist-policy.md](../../overview/credit-account/allowedlist-policy.md "mention"). You can see that list by scrolling on the right tab of the dashboard.

{% content-ref url="../../overview/credit-account/allowedlist-policy.md" %}
[allowedlist-policy.md](../../overview/credit-account/allowedlist-policy.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Swapping your asset to another can have a direct impact on your Health Factor, so please do keep a check on it in order to make sure you don't run into a risk of a liquidation.
