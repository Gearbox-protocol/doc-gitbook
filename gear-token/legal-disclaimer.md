NEITHER GEARBOX FOUNDATION (THE COMPANY), ANY OF THE PROJECT CONTRIBUTORS (THE GEARBOX CONTRIBUTORS) WHO HAVE WORKED ON THE GEARBOX PROTOCOL (AS DEFINED HEREIN) OR PROJECT TO DEVELOP THE GEARBOX PROTOCOL IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER, ANY DISTRIBUTOR AND/OR VENDOR OF GEAR TOKENS (OR SUCH OTHER RE-NAMED OR SUCCESSOR TICKER CODE OR NAME OF SUCH TOKENS) (THE DISTRIBUTOR), NOR ANY SERVICE PROVIDER SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY KIND OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGE OR LOSS WHATSOEVER WHICH YOU MAY SUFFER IN CONNECTION WITH ACCESSING THE PAPER, DECK OR MATERIAL RELATING TO GEAR (THE TOKEN DOCUMENTATION) AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE AT HTTPS://DOCS.GEARBOX.FINANCE/ (THE WEBSITE, INCLUDING ANY SUB-DOMAINS THEREON) OR ANY OTHER WEBSITES OR MATERIALS PUBLISHED OR COMMUNICATED BY THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES FROM TIME TO TIME.

**Project purpose**: You agree that you are acquiring GEAR to participate in the Gearbox Protocol and to obtain services on the ecosystem thereon. The Company, the Distributor and their respective affiliates would develop and contribute to the underlying source code for the Gearbox Protocol. The Company is acting solely as an armsâ€™ length third party in relation to the GEAR distribution, and not in the capacity as a financial advisor or fiduciary of any person with regard to the distribution of GEAR.

**Nature of the Token Documentation**: The Token Documentation is a conceptual paper that articulates some of the main design principles and ideas for the creation of a digital token to be known as GEAR. The Token Documentation and the Website are intended for general informational purposes only and do not constitute a prospectus, an offer document, an offer of securities, a solicitation for investment, any offer to sell any product, item, or asset (whether digital or otherwise), or any offer to engage in business with any external individual or entity provided in said documentation. The information herein may not be exhaustive and does not imply any element of, or solicit in any way, a legally-binding or contractual relationship. There is no assurance as to the accuracy or completeness of such information and no representation, warranty or undertaking is or purported to be provided as to the accuracy or completeness of such information. Where the Token Documentation or the Website includes information that has been obtained from third party sources, the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates and/or the Gearbox contributors have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of such information. Further, you acknowledge that the project development roadmap, protocol/network functionality are subject to change and that the Token Documentation or the Website may become outdated as a result; and neither the Company nor the Distributor is under any obligation to update or correct this document in connection therewith.

**Validity of Token Documentation and Website**: Nothing in the Token Documentation or the Website constitutes any offer by the Company, the Distributor, or the Gearbox contributors to sell any GEAR (as defined herein) nor shall it or any part of it nor the fact of its presentation form the basis of, or be relied upon in connection with, any contract or investment decision. Nothing contained in the Token Documentation or the Website is or may be relied upon as a promise, representation or undertaking as to the future performance of the Gearbox Protocol. The agreement between the Distributor (or any third party) and you, in relation to any distribution or transfer of GEAR, is to be governed only by the separate terms and conditions of such agreement.

The information set out in the Token Documentation and the Website is for community discussion only and is not legally binding. No person is bound to enter into any contract or binding legal commitment in relation to the acquisition of GEAR, and no digital asset or other form of payment is to be accepted on the basis of the Token Documentation or the Website. The agreement for distribution of GEAR and/or continued holding of GEAR shall be governed by a separate set of Terms and Conditions or Token Distribution Agreement (as the case may be) setting out the terms of such distribution and/or continued holding of GEAR (the Terms and Conditions), which shall be separately provided to you or made available on the Website. The Terms and Conditions must be read together with the Token Documentation. In the event of any inconsistencies between the Terms and Conditions and the Token Documentation or the Website, the Terms and Conditions shall prevail.

**Deemed Representations and Warranties**: By accessing the Token Documentation or the Website (or any part thereof), you shall be deemed to represent and warrant to the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, and the Gearbox contributors as follows:

1. in any decision to acquire any GEAR, you have not relied and shall not rely on any statement set out in the Token Documentation or the Website;
2. you shall at your own expense ensure compliance with all laws, regulatory requirements and restrictions applicable to you (as the case may be);
3. you acknowledge, understand and agree that GEAR may have no value, there is no guarantee or representation of value or liquidity for GEAR, and GEAR is not an investment product nor is it intended for any speculative investment whatsoever;
4. none of the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, and/or the Gearbox contributors shall be responsible for or liable for the value of GEAR, the transferability and/or liquidity of GEAR and/or the availability of any market for GEAR through third parties or otherwise; and
5. you acknowledge, understand and agree that you are not eligible to participate in the distribution of GEAR if you are a citizen, national, resident (tax or otherwise), domiciliary and/or green card or permanent visa holder of a geographic area or country (i) where it is likely that the distribution of GEAR would be construed as the sale of a security (howsoever named), financial service or investment product and/or (ii) where participation in token distributions is prohibited by applicable law, decree, regulation, treaty, or administrative act (including without limitation the United States of America, Canada, and the People's Republic of China); and to this effect you agree to provide all such identity verification document when requested in order for the relevant checks to be carried out.

The Company, the Distributor and the Gearbox contributors do not and do not purport to make, and hereby disclaims, all representations, warranties or undertaking to any entity or person (including without limitation warranties as to the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of the contents of the Token Documentation or the Website, or any other materials published by the Company or the Distributor). To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates and service providers shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other losses of any kind, in tort, contract or otherwise (including, without limitation, any liability arising from default or negligence on the part of any of them, or any loss of revenue, income or profits, and loss of use or data) arising from the use of the Token Documentation or the Website, or any other materials published, or its contents (including without limitation any errors or omissions) or otherwise arising in connection with the same. Prospective acquirors of GEAR should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and uncertainties (including financial and legal risks and uncertainties) associated with the distribution of GEAR, the Company, the Distributor and the Gearbox contributors.

**GEAR Token**: GEAR are designed to be utilised, and that is the goal of the GEAR distribution. In particular, it is highlighted that GEAR:

1. does not have any tangible or physical manifestation, and does not have any intrinsic value/pricing (nor does any person make any representation or give any commitment as to its value);
2. is non-refundable, not redeemable for any assets of any entity or organisation, and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other digital asset) or any payment obligation by the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates;
3. does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any form with respect to the Company, the Distributor (or any of their respective affiliates), or their revenues or assets, including without limitation any right to receive future dividends, revenue, shares, ownership right or stake, share or security, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property or licence rights), right to receive accounts, financial statements or other financial data, the right to requisition or participate in shareholder meetings, the right to nominate a director, or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the Gearbox Protocol, the Company, the Distributor and/or their service providers;
4. is not intended to represent any rights under a contract for differences or under any other contract the purpose or intended purpose of which is to secure a profit or avoid a loss;
5. is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic money), payment instrument, security, commodity, bond, debt instrument, unit in a collective investment or managed investment scheme or any other kind of financial instrument or investment;
6. is not a loan to the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates, is not intended to represent a debt owed by the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates, and there is no expectation of profit nor interest payment; and
7. does not provide the token holder with any ownership or other interest in the Company, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates.

Notwithstanding the GEAR distribution, users have no economic or legal right over or beneficial interest in the assets of the Company, the Distributor, or any of their affiliates after the token distribution.

GEAR may only be utilised on the Gearbox Protocol, and ownership of the same carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use GEAR as a means to enable usage of and interaction within the Gearbox Protocol. The secondary market pricing of GEAR is not dependent on the effort of the Gearbox contributors, and there is no token functionality or scheme designed to control or manipulate such secondary pricing.

For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Company nor the Distributor deals in, or is in the business of buying or selling any virtual asset or digital payment token (including GEAR). Any sale or distribution of tokens would be performed during a restricted initial period solely for the purpose of obtaining project development funds, raising market/brand awareness, as well as community building and social engagement; this is not conducted with any element of repetitiveness or regularity which would constitute a business.

To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading GEAR does develop, it would be run and operated wholly independently of the Company, the Distributor, the distribution of GEAR and the Gearbox Protocol. Neither the Company nor the Distributor will create such secondary markets nor will either entity act as an exchange for GEAR.

**Informational purposes only**: The information set out herein is only conceptual, and describes the future development goals for the Gearbox Protocol to be developed. In particular, the project roadmap in the Token Documentation is being shared in order to outline some of the plans of the Gearbox contributors, and is provided solely for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES and does not constitute any binding commitment. Please do not rely on this information in deciding whether to participate in the token distribution because ultimately, the development, release, and timing of any products, features or functionality remains at the sole discretion of the Company, the Distributor or their respective affiliates, and is subject to change.
